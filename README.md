# Data-Analysis
The following listed projects are a mix of data analysis, data visualisation and machine learning. 

## District School Education Analysis
Analyse the district and state school education data based on literacy rate, teachers, infrastructure. We also plot the choropleth map for states based on sex ratio, literacy, infrastructure.

## [New York High Schools](https://github.com/deepankarpal89/Data-Analysis/blob/master/Analysing%2BNew%2BYork%2BHigh%2BSchools.ipynb)
We look at data for New York High Schools and analyse the factors which have a corelation with the SAT Score like Gender, Racial Profiling, Safety. Its a descriptive analysis only.

## [Police Killings in USA](https://github.com/deepankarpal89/Data-Analysis/blob/master/Analysing%2BPolice%2BKillings%2Bin%2BUSA.ipynb)
We analyse the killings in USA based on states, Race, Income. We also plot a choropleth map of the states and the number of killings in each state. The choropleth map is made using Folium. Due to some unresolved error one is unable to observe that map on github repository.

## [Recent College Graduates](https://github.com/deepankarpal89/Data-Analysis/blob/master/Analysing%2BRecent%2BGrads.ipynb)
Analyse the graduates based on the major. We look at the employment scenario, the college and non college jobs availability for various majors. The gender distribution for majors.

## [Analyse movie ratings](https://github.com/deepankarpal89/Data-Analysis/blob/master/analysing_movie_reviews.ipynb)
See how the ratings of fandango are different from those given by Metacritic and Rotten Tomatoes. See if they are biased in their approach or not.

## [Pixar Movies](https://github.com/deepankarpal89/Data-Analysis/blob/master/Pixar%2BMovies%2BAnalysis.ipynb)
Analyse the pixar movies in terms of their ratings by Metacritic, IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, Oscars Nominated and Oscars Won, Domestic and Worldwide Revenue.

## [Predicting Bike Rentals](https://github.com/deepankarpal89/Data-Analysis/blob/master/Predicting%2BBike%2BRentals.ipynb)
Analyse the Bike rentals in terms of days and months. Predict the no of bikes rented by using Linear Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest methods, comparing the three methods based on root mean square error.

## [Jeopardy Game Show](https://github.com/deepankarpal89/Data-Analysis/blob/master/Jeopardy%2BAnalysis.ipynb)
Analyse the game show Jeopardy in terms of topics with most question asked, money allocated. We also look at a possible strategy to choose topics while preparing for the game show in terms of No of answers which are contained in questions, questions overlap.

## [Predicting Board Games Reviews](https://github.com/deepankarpal89/Data-Analysis/blob/master/Predicting%2BBoard%2BGames%2BReviews.ipynb)
Look at ratings of Board Games. Use K-Means Clustering to further analyse them. Predict ratings using Linear Regression.

## [Star Wars Survey Analysis](https://github.com/deepankarpal89/Data-Analysis/blob/master/Star%2BWars%2BSurvey%2BAnalysis.ipynb)
Analyse the Star Wars Episodes based on view counts, Ratings. Also how males and females view the franchise.
